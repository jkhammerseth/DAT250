Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved:
Tried to install mongoDB on mac, seems like it went ok, i can start mongoDB and check if the service is running. But nothing works, I cant 
call any commands, "mongo", "mongosh" and "mongod" doest register as commands in the terminal. I have tried several folders where mongo is 
installed to no success. So i gave up on trying it on mac. Thankfully I also have a windows machine.

Installed mongosh on windows just fine.

Could not validate package because I couldnt get the install to work, tried different computers with no luck.
