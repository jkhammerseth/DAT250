# Report Software technology assignment 4


## Experiment 2
I had some issues getting started with this experiment, but once I got the first steps in everything else followed. Figured out a good way to store 
todos was in an arraylist, and i had to make some sort of id for the todos that would be created, so i made a simple counter for creations and used it 
like an id.

Biggest issue was with the creation of todos, but with some experimentation i figured it out. req.body().substring() had me real frustrated for a while.

The helperfunctions isLong and getTodo helped alot.



Might look into experiment 3 and 4 later
